# React rules

## General

Don't import React, e.g. `import React from 'react'`. Instead use statements like `import { useState } from 'react'`.


## Components

Use const/ES6 arrow functions for component defintions by default.

## Props

Use `type` statements for props.
Comply with ESLint prefer-destructuring rule

## Styling

Use Tailwind CSS for styling whenever possible. Fallback to inline styles only when necessary.

Never use independent css files.
